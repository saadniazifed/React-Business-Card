# Digital Business Card Project.

My first React project: A Digital Business Card Project made using ReactJS with CSS Styling.

This is the first React Project from Learn React for Free Course on Scrimba suggested by The Odin Project.

Spec and details for the assignment can be found [Here](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/react-section-1-solo-project-coce646e88eea46f91af43ca4)

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.

### Features/UI UX Design
* React is used for the first time after spending 8 months learning Vanilla JavaScript.
* Flexbox is used for the majority of the alignment. Since it was a small project, didn't feel the need to apply any Grid on it.


## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
Learning the foundations of ReactJS library was fun. It became easier and intuitive once I started to put the theory in this project. This project gave me the practice I needed to dig deeper in the concepts of ReactJS and harness the power of this amazing library.
